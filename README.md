# Hello, I'm Drew 👋🏻 🧑🏻‍💻

I'm currently a Staff Software Engineer @ reddit working to improve their Android app. I am passionate about building high quality **Android** and mobile applications as well as contributing to the world of open-source. 

Some of my favorite topics in Android right now are:
* Compose (Ui/Compiler/UiState)
* Kotlin Multiplaform
* Dependency Injection
* Anvil

## Here are a few of my projects

[![DeckBox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r0adkll/DeckBox/modern/.github/art/GithubBanner.png)](https://github.com/r0adkll/DeckBox)

**DeckBox** is an unofficial deck building app for creating and managing your Pokémon TCG decklists. Whether you are building and tweaking the top decks in the meta or just experimenting with some spicy rogue decks, search through a large collection of Pokémon cards that span from the latest expansion all the way back to the base set.
